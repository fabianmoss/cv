  abstract = {Popular music often features a high amount of stable harmonic patterns, which facilitates the establishment of stylistic idioms and recognizability, and the changing frequencies of such patterns are closely linked to style and genre: new patterns arise while others die out. Here, we employ a content-based transmission model from cultural evolution research and compare three 20th-century popular music genres from different geographical and cultural contexts. Prior work on the evolution of harmony often only considers a small vocabulary of chords with a binary distance metric (same or different). Here, we introduce music-theoretically sensible notions of harmonic distance between chords, that allows us to arrive at more fine-grained results regarding relative influences of different kinds of harmonic relations on diachronic changes. Inferring the substitution probabilities for different chord classes, our results indicate an increasing usage of chord categories, whereas chord extensions remain relatively stable. Our study provides a principled methodology for cross-cultural research on the evolution of harmony.},

Annotations were collaboratively created and reviewed by a pool of trained music theorists. Collaboration took place asynchronously online via a semi-automated GitHub-based workflow designed for quality assurance, allowing cycles of revisions and reviews until consensus is reached. The full revision history is retained, providing data for further empirical research on inter-annotator agreement and related topics. We also present descriptive statistics about the nine corpora and the dataset as a whole, including comparisons of pitch-class contents, phrase lengths, modulations, and cadence types. We conclude with a discussion of our musicological principles for corpus building and considerations of representability.},

We then implement an LSTM-based neural network which takes these vectors as input with the goal of predicting a chord given its surrounding context in a chord sequence. We use the variability in prediction accuracy to quantify the stylistic differences among various composers in order to detect idiomatic uses of some chords by some composers. The historical breadth of the corpus used allows us to draw some conclusions about broader patterns of changing chord usage across musical periods from Renaissance to Modernity.},

This study presents a novel approach for the study of its historical development, exploring in particular the concept of mode. Based on a large dataset of approximately 13,000 musical pieces in MIDI format, we present two models to infer both the number and characteristics of modes of different historical periods from first principles: a geometric model of modes as clusters of musical pieces in a non-Euclidean space, and a cognitively plausible Bayesian model of modes as Dirichlet distributions. We use the geometric model to determine the optimal number of modes for five historical epochs via unsupervised learning and apply the probabilistic model to infer the characteristics of the modes. Our results show that the inference of four modes is most plausible in the Renaissance, that two modes\textendash corresponding to major and minor\textendash are most appropriate in the Baroque and Classical eras, whereas no clear separation into distinct modes is found for the 19th century.},

  abstract  = {Chord-based harmony is an important aspect of many types of Western music, across genres, regions, and historical eras. However, the consistent representation and comparison of harmony across a wide range of styles (e.g., classical music, Jazz, Rock, or Pop) is a challenging task. Moreover, even within a single musical style, multiple theories of harmony exist, each relying on its own (possibly implicit) assumptions and leading to harmonic analyses with a distinct focus (e.g., on the root of a chord vs. its bass note) or representation (e.g., spelled vs. enharmonic pitch classes). Cross-stylistic and cross-theory comparisons are therefore even more difficult, particularly in a large-scale computational setting that requires a common overarching representation. To address these problems, we propose a model which allows for the representation of chords at multiple levels of abstraction: from chord realizations on the score level (if available), to pitch-class collections (including a potential application of different equivalences, such as enharmonic or octave equivalence), to pitch- and chord-level functions and higher-order abstractions. Importantly, our proposed model is also well-defined for theories which do not specify information at each level of abstraction (e.g., some theories make no claims about harmonic function), representing only those harmonic properties that are explicitly included and inducing others where possible (e.g., deriving scale degrees from root and key information). Our model thus represents an important step towards a unified representation of harmony and its various applications.},

  abstract  = {When listeners hear stimuli drawn from a Western classical context and are asked to rate the perceived fit of subsequent probe tones, a tonal hierarchy emerges that is consistent with several music-theoretical accounts. The perceptual reality underlying tonal hierarchies has seen much empirical support within and beyond Western classical music. However, a recurrent concern is that such hierarchies may be an artifact of the presence or absence of a probe in a given context. Furthermore, it is currently unclear how the perceived fit varies between different idiomatically valid contexts within the same musical style. Here, 40 participants provided fit ratings in a probe-tone paradigm using scalar and cadential Western classical contexts in both the major and minor mode. The ratings are compared with four models of the tonal hierarchy. The first model derives from average listeners' ratings in a prior perceptual study, and another one is a music-theoretically motivated adjustment of it. Additionally, two models derived from pitch-class distributions in musical corpora are tested. Using Bayesian Mixed Effects models and a model-comparison approach, the four models of tonal hierarchy as well as their combinations are used to predict the new behavioral data. The results are compared with a baseline model that encodes if and how often a given probe tone was contained in the context. Our findings reveal that scalar and cadential contexts can induce differences in perceived tonal fit, with the ratings obtained within cadential contexts showing greater resemblance to models of tonal hierarchies. Additionally, while little evidence is observed in scalar contexts that the models of tonal hierarchy carry incremental predictive power over the baseline model, such evidence is abundant in cadential contexts. The results suggest that probe-tone profiles induced by cadential contexts are shaped by cognitive long-term representations of musical structure, while probe-tone profiles induced by scalar contexts are predominantly guided by lower-level short-term sensory priming. *SAH and FCM contributed equally.

However, despite their structure being closely related to the cognitively and musically relevant properties of a piece, many existing approaches treat pitch-class distributions as fixed templates. In this paper, we introduce the Tonal Diffusion Model, which provides a more structured and interpretable statistical model of pitch-class distributions by incorporating geometric and algebraic structures known from music theory as well as insights from music cognition. Our model explains the pitch-class distributions of musical pieces by assuming tones to be generated through a latent cognitive process on the Tonnetz, a well-established representation for harmonic relations. Specifically, we assume that all tones in a piece are generated by taking a sequence of interval steps on the Tonnetz starting from a unique tonal origin. We provide a description in terms of a Bayesian generative model and show how the latent variables and parameters can be efficiently inferred. The model is quantitatively evaluated on a corpus of 248 pieces from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic era and describes the empirical pitch-class distributions more accurately than conventional template-based models. On three concrete musical examples, we demonstrate that our model captures relevant harmonic characteristics of the pieces in a compact and interpretable way, also reflecting stylistic aspects of the respective epoch.},

Vor allem Komponisten der sp\"aten Klassik und der Romantik machen schamlos von enharmonischen Verwechslungen Gebrauch und erreichen so ungeahnte H\"ohen der Musik, die~sich nun nicht mehr im sicheren Hafen der Diatonik bewegt, sondern die gesamte Chromatik~beansprucht. Die Analyse der Musik des sp\"aten 18. bis fr\"uhen 20. Jahrhunderts steht somit auch vor anderen Herausforderungen als bei Bachschen Chor\"alen oder Sch\"utzschen Motetten. In diesem Artikel wird zun\"achst John Cloughs (1930-2003) Begriff der Flip-Flip Circles~vorgestellt und deren gruppentheoretische Aspekte erl\"autert. Eine interessante Anwendung finden sie in der Theorie der Tonfelder von Albert Simon (1926-2000), die dieser auf der Basis harmonischer Analysen entwickelte. Da davon auszugehen ist, dass beide voneinander keine~Kenntnis hatten, ist es umso interessanter, diese beiden v\"ollig unterschiedlichen Zug\"ange zu~musikalischer Analyse miteinander in Verbindung zu bringen.},

  abstract  = {The subject of this paper is the cognition of triadic progressions in 19th century tonal music. Music psychological research concerning the cognition of harmonic progressions mainly relies on diatonic music in which triads are easily relatable to a key. Triadic distance is therefore measured in terms of root relationships to the tonal center, the tonic (Krumhansl \&amp; Kessler, 1982). This conception is not directly applicable to chromatic music where musical coherence is not only obtained by common a key. Transformational music theory puts strong emphasis on voice-leading parsimony as a measure of distance. The most efficient transformations between major and minor triads are P (parallel), R (relative) and L (leading-tone exchange), which is also in accordance with empirical findings of diatonic triadic relatedness (Krumhansl, 1998). Notably, P and R generate an octatonic scale containing eight major and minor triads which are claimed to be functionally equivalent. Transformational analyses result in sequential patterns of triadic progressions and an overarching key is not required. Based on an extended notion of function and acknowledging that there are compelling arguments for both hierarchical and sequential representations of the cognition of harmonic progressions a multi-level model is proposed that combines both approaches, adopting features of the generative model by Rohrmeier (2011). The two main components of the model are the concept of functional equivalence and the distinction between the hierarchic-syntactic cognition of functional progressions and the schematic cognition of functional values.},

  abstract  = {Music analysis, in particular harmonic analysis, is concerned with the way pitches are organized in pieces of music, and a range of empirical applications have been developed, for example, for chord recognition or key finding. Naturally, these approaches rely on some operationalization of the concepts they aim to investigate. In this study, we take a complementary approach and discover latent tonal structures in an unsupervised manner. We use the topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation and apply it to a large historical corpus of musical pieces from the Western classical tradition. This method conceives topics as distributions of pitch classes without assuming a priori that they correspond to either chords, keys, or other harmonic phenomena. To illustrate the generative process assumed by the model, we create an artificial corpus with arbitrary parameter settings and compare the sampled pieces to real compositions. The results we obtain by applying the topic model to the musical corpus show that the inferred topics have music-theoretically meaningful interpretations. In particular, topics cover contiguous segments on the line of fifths and mostly correspond to diatonic sets. Moreover, tracing the prominence of topics over the course of music history over {$\sim\sim<$}math display="inline" id="mml-inline1" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}mo{$>\sim<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$}600 years reflects changes in the ways pitch classes are employed in musical compositions and reveals particularly strong changes at the transition from common-practice to extended tonality in the 19th century.},

Here, we analyze more than 40000 pieces of plainchant to better understand the evolution of modes and pitch distributions in a period of five centuries that saw the development of the Western modal practice. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical Markov mixture model to analyze the eight medieval modes and their substructure represented as pitch distributions and observe their historical changes. We found that the individual modes exhibit internal clusters, that the relative frequencies of the eight modes remained remarkably stable over time, and that there were comparatively large changes in the pitch distributions of individual modes. We discuss our results on the background of musicological insights and point to the need for further interdisciplinary work.},

  abstract  = {Western musical styles use a large variety of chords and vertical sonorities. Based on objective acoustical properties, chords can be situated on a dissonant-consonant continuum. While this might to some extent converge with the unpleasant-pleasant continuum, subjective liking might diverge for various chord forms from music across different styles. Our study aimed to investigate how well appraisals of the roughness and pleasantness dimensions of isolated chords taken from real-world music are predicted by Parncutt's established model of sensory dissonance. Furthermore, we related these subjective ratings to style of origin and acoustical features of the chords as well as musical sophistication of the raters. Ratings were obtained for chords deemed representative of the harmonic language of three different musical styles (classical, jazz and avant-garde music), plus randomly generated chords. Results indicate that pleasantness and roughness ratings were, on average, mirror opposites; however, their relative distribution differed greatly across styles, reflecting different underlying aesthetic ideals. Parncutt's model only weakly predicted ratings for all but Classical chords, suggesting that listeners' appraisal of the dissonance and pleasantness of chords bears not only on stimulus-side but also on listener-side factors. Indeed, we found that levels of musical sophistication negatively predicted listeners' tendency to rate the consonance and pleasantness of any one chord as coupled measures, suggesting that musical education and expertise may serve to individuate how these musical dimensions are apprehended.},

  abstract   = {Many structural aspects of music, such as tonality, can be expressed using hierarchical representations. In music analysis, so-called keyscapes can be used to map a key estimate (e.g., C major, F minor) to each subsection of a piece of music, thus providing an intuitive visual representation of its tonality, in particular of the hierarchical organization of local and global keys. However, that approach is limited in that the mapping relies on assumptions that are specific to common-practice tonality, such as the existence of 24 major and minor keys. This limitation can be circumvented by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the tonal space. The DFT does not rely on style-specific theoretical assumptions but only presupposes an encoding of the music as pitch classes in 12-tone equal temperament. We introduce wavescapes, a novel visualization method for tonal hierarchies that combines the visual representation of keyscapes with music analysis based on the DFT. Since wavescapes produce visual analyses deterministically, a number of potential subjective biases are removed. By concentrating on one or more Fourier coefficients, the role of the analyst is thus focused on the interpretation and contextualization of the results. We illustrate the usefulness of this method for computational music theory by analyzing eight compositions from different historical epochs and composers (Josquin, Bach, Liszt, Chopin, Scriabin, Webern, Coltrane, Ligeti) in terms of the phase and magnitude of several Fourier coefficients. We also provide a Python library that allows such visualizations to be easily generated for any piece of music for which a symbolic score or audio recording is available.},

In particular, we emphasize the importance of interactive web applications for music visualization and analysis. This is demonstrated using the example of the application midiVERTO which affords interactions with the pitch-class content of musical pieces encoded in MIDI format without requiring in-depth understanding of the underlying mathematics. We illustrate the analytical value of studying families of phantom curves by applying the concept to music from a Broadway musical, a video game, and a Hollywood movie. This process of discovery thus testifies to the fact that digital tools can bridge disciplinary boundaries between music theory and mathematics, and this interaction can generate new scientific knowledge.},

With such a combination, we create a visual representation of a piece's multidimensional qualia, where different colours indicate saliency in chromaticity, diadicity, triadicity, octatonicity, diatonicity, and whole-tone quality. At the centre of our methods are: 1) the formal definition of the Fourier Qualia Space (FQS), 2) its particular ordering of DFT coefficients that delineate regions linked to different musical aesthetics, and 3) the mapping of such regions into a coloured wavescape. Furthermore, we demonstrate the intrinsic capability of the FQS to express qualia ambiguity and map it into a synopsis wavescape. Finally, we showcase the application of our methods by presenting a few analytical remarks on Bach's Three-part Invention BWV 795, Debussy's Reflets dans l'eau, and Webern's Four Pieces for Violin and Piano, Op. 7, No. 1, unveiling increasingly ambiguous wavescapes.},
