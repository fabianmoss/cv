  abstract = {This study focuses on the exploration of the possibilities arising from the application of an NLP word-embedding method (Word2Vec) to a large corpus of musical chord sequences, spanning multiple musical periods. First, we analyse the clustering of the embedded vectors produced by Word2Vec in order to probe its ability to learn common musical patterns. We then implement an LSTM-based neural network which takes these vectors as input with the goal of predicting a chord given its surrounding context in a chord sequence. We use the variability in prediction accuracy to quantify the stylistic differences among various composers in order to detect idiomatic uses of some chords by some composers. The historical breadth of the corpus used allows us to draw some conclusions about broader patterns of changing chord usage across musical periods from Renaissance to Modernity.},

  abstract = {Tonality is one of the most central theoretical concepts for the analysis of Western classical music. This study presents a novel approach for the study of its historical development, exploring in particular the concept of mode. Based on a large dataset of approximately 13,000 musical pieces in MIDI format, we present two models to infer both the number and characteristics of modes of different historical periods from first principles: a geometric model of modes as clusters of musical pieces in a non-Euclidean space, and a cognitively plausible Bayesian model of modes as Dirichlet distributions. We use the geometric model to determine the optimal number of modes for five historical epochs via unsupervised learning and apply the probabilistic model to infer the characteristics of the modes. Our results show that the inference of four modes is most plausible in the Renaissance, that two modes–corresponding to major and minor–are most appropriate in the Baroque and Classical eras, whereas no clear separation into distinct modes is found for the 19th century.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a web application for visualizing the tonality of a piece of music -- the organization of its chords and scales -- at a high level of abstraction and with coordinated playback. The application applies the discrete Fourier transform to the pitch-class domain of a user-specified segmentation of a MIDI file and visualizes the Fourier coefficients' trajectories. Since the coefficients indicate different musical properties, such as harmonic function, triadicity, and diatonicity, the application isolates aspects of a piece's tonality and shows their development in time. The aim of the application is to bridge a gap between mathematical music theory, musicology, and the general public by making the discrete Fourier transform as applied to the pitch-class domain accessible without requiring advanced mathematical knowledge or programming skills up front.},

  abstract = {When listeners hear stimuli drawn from a Western classical context and are asked to rate the perceived fit of subsequent probe tones, a tonal hierarchy emerges that is consistent with several music-theoretical accounts. The perceptual reality underlying tonal hierarchies has seen much empirical support within and beyond Western classical music. However, a recurrent concern is that such hierarchies may be an artifact of the presence or absence of a probe in a given context. Furthermore, it is currently unclear how the perceived fit varies between different idiomatically valid contexts within the same musical style. Here, 40 participants provided fit ratings in a probe-tone paradigm using scalar and cadential Western classical contexts in both the major and minor mode. The ratings are compared with four models of the tonal hierarchy. The first model derives from average listeners' ratings in a prior perceptual study, and another one is a music-theoretically motivated adjustment of it. Additionally, two models derived from pitch-class distributions in musical corpora are tested. Using Bayesian Mixed Effects models and a model-comparison approach, the four models of tonal hierarchy as well as their combinations are used to predict the new behavioral data. The results are compared with a baseline model that encodes if and how often a given probe tone was contained in the context. Our findings reveal that scalar and cadential contexts can induce differences in perceived tonal fit, with the ratings obtained within cadential contexts showing greater resemblance to models of tonal hierarchies. Additionally, while little evidence is observed in scalar contexts that the models of tonal hierarchy carry incremental predictive power over the baseline model, such evidence is abundant in cadential contexts. The results suggest that probe-tone profiles induced by cadential contexts are shaped by cognitive long-term representations of musical structure, while probe-tone profiles induced by scalar contexts are predominantly guided by lower-level short-term sensory priming. *SAH and FCM contributed equally.

However, despite their structure being closely related to the cognitively and musically relevant properties of a piece, many existing approaches treat pitch-class distributions as fixed templates. In this paper, we introduce the Tonal Diffusion Model, which provides a more structured and interpretable statistical model of pitch-class distributions by incorporating geometric and algebraic structures known from music theory as well as insights from music cognition. Our model explains the pitch-class distributions of musical pieces by assuming tones to be generated through a latent cognitive process on the Tonnetz, a well-established representation for harmonic relations. Specifically, we assume that all tones in a piece are generated by taking a sequence of interval steps on the Tonnetz starting from a unique tonal origin. We provide a description in terms of a Bayesian generative model and show how the latent variables and parameters can be efficiently inferred. The model is quantitatively evaluated on a corpus of 248 pieces from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic era and describes the empirical pitch-class distributions more accurately than conventional template-based models. On three concrete musical examples, we demonstrate that our model captures relevant harmonic characteristics of the pieces in a compact and interpretable way, also reflecting stylistic aspects of the respective epoch.},

  abstract = {Dass Mathematik und Musik eine ganze Menge gemeinsam haben, ist kein Novum. Hebamme der abendländischen Musik war schließlich kein geringerer als Pythagoras von Samos (ca. 570-510 v. Chr.), der entdeckte, dass Konsonanz von Tönen eine Frage ganzzahliger Schwingungsverhältnisse ist. Die Meister der westlichen Musik hatten ihren Geburtshelfer jedoch~bald schon vergessen, bzw. verdrängt, denn das berühmte pythagoräische Komma, die Differenz von sieben Oktaven und zwölf Quinten, machte ein perfektes, „wohl temperiertes“ System~bewiesenermaßen mathematisch unmöglich. Doch damit konnte und kann man durchaus gut~leben. Vor allem Komponisten der späten Klassik und der Romantik machen schamlos von enharmonischen Verwechslungen Gebrauch und erreichen so ungeahnte Höhen der Musik, die~sich nun nicht mehr im sicheren Hafen der Diatonik bewegt, sondern die gesamte Chromatik~beansprucht. Die Analyse der Musik des späten 18. bis frühen 20. Jahrhunderts steht somit auch vor anderen Herausforderungen als bei Bachschen Chorälen oder Schützschen Motetten. In diesem Artikel wird zunächst John Cloughs (1930-2003) Begriff der Flip-Flip Circles~vorgestellt und deren gruppentheoretische Aspekte erläutert. Eine interessante Anwendung finden sie in der Theorie der Tonfelder von Albert Simon (1926-2000), die dieser auf der Basis harmonischer Analysen entwickelte. Da davon auszugehen ist, dass beide voneinander keine~Kenntnis hatten, ist es umso interessanter, diese beiden völlig unterschiedlichen Zugänge zu~musikalischer Analyse miteinander in Verbindung zu bringen.},

  abstract = {The subject of this paper is the cognition of triadic progressions in 19th century tonal music. Music psychological research concerning the cognition of harmonic progressions mainly relies on diatonic music in which triads are easily relatable to a key. Triadic distance is therefore measured in terms of root relationships to the tonal center, the tonic (Krumhansl \&amp; Kessler, 1982). This conception is not directly applicable to chromatic music where musical coherence is not only obtained by common a key. Transformational music theory puts strong emphasis on voice-leading parsimony as a measure of distance. The most efficient transformations between major and minor triads are P (parallel), R (relative) and L (leading-tone exchange), which is also in accordance with empirical findings of diatonic triadic relatedness (Krumhansl, 1998). Notably, P and R generate an octatonic scale containing eight major and minor triads which are claimed to be functionally equivalent. Transformational analyses result in sequential patterns of triadic progressions and an overarching key is not required. Based on an extended notion of function and acknowledging that there are compelling arguments for both hierarchical and sequential representations of the cognition of harmonic progressions a multi-level model is proposed that combines both approaches, adopting features of the generative model by Rohrmeier (2011). The two main components of the model are the concept of functional equivalence and the distinction between the hierarchic-syntactic cognition of functional progressions and the schematic cognition of functional values.},

  abstract = {Music analysis, in particular harmonic analysis, is concerned with the way pitches are organized in pieces of music, and a range of empirical applications have been developed, for example, for chord recognition or key finding. Naturally, these approaches rely on some operationalization of the concepts they aim to investigate. In this study, we take a complementary approach and discover latent tonal structures in an unsupervised manner. We use the topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation and apply it to a large historical corpus of musical pieces from the Western classical tradition. This method conceives topics as distributions of pitch classes without assuming a priori that they correspond to either chords, keys, or other harmonic phenomena. To illustrate the generative process assumed by the model, we create an artificial corpus with arbitrary parameter settings and compare the sampled pieces to real compositions. The results we obtain by applying the topic model to the musical corpus show that the inferred topics have music-theoretically meaningful interpretations. In particular, topics cover contiguous segments on the line of fifths and mostly correspond to diatonic sets. Moreover, tracing the prominence of topics over the course of music history over ∼∼{$<$}math display="inline" id="mml-inline1" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}mo{$>$}∼{$<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$}600 years reflects changes in the ways pitch classes are employed in musical compositions and reveals particularly strong changes at the transition from common-practice to extended tonality in the 19th century.},

  abstract = {In this study, we determine the fundamental role of the line of fifths for the organization of tonal material by applying dimensionality reduction to a large historical corpus of pitch-class counts (ca. 1360–1940). We observe a historically growing trend in the exploitation of the fifths range, i.e. the size of segments that pitch-class distributions cover on the line of fifths. Moreover, we introduce the novel concept of pitch-class (co-)evolution, which traces the changing co-occurrence of pitch classes over time and likewise reaffirms the centrality of this linear tonal space from a historical angle, allowing us also to distinguish between historical periods in terms of the usage of pitch classes.},

  abstract = {Western musical styles use a large variety of chords and vertical sonorities. Based on objective acoustical properties, chords can be situated on a dissonant-consonant continuum. While this might to some extent converge with the unpleasant-pleasant continuum, subjective liking might diverge for various chord forms from music across different styles. Our study aimed to investigate how well appraisals of the roughness and pleasantness dimensions of isolated chords taken from real-world music are predicted by Parncutt’s established model of sensory dissonance. Furthermore, we related these subjective ratings to style of origin and acoustical features of the chords as well as musical sophistication of the raters. Ratings were obtained for chords deemed representative of the harmonic language of three different musical styles (classical, jazz and avant-garde music), plus randomly generated chords. Results indicate that pleasantness and roughness ratings were, on average, mirror opposites; however, their relative distribution differed greatly across styles, reflecting different underlying aesthetic ideals. Parncutt’s model only weakly predicted ratings for all but Classical chords, suggesting that listeners’ appraisal of the dissonance and pleasantness of chords bears not only on stimulus-side but also on listener-side factors. Indeed, we found that levels of musical sophistication negatively predicted listeners’ tendency to rate the consonance and pleasantness of any one chord as coupled measures, suggesting that musical education and expertise may serve to individuate how these musical dimensions are apprehended.},

  abstract = {Many structural aspects of music, such as tonality, can be expressed using hierarchical representations. In music analysis, so-called keyscapes can be used to map a key estimate (e.g., C major, F minor) to each subsection of a piece of music, thus providing an intuitive visual representation of its tonality, in particular of the hierarchical organization of local and global keys. However, that approach is limited in that the mapping relies on assumptions that are specific to common-practice tonality, such as the existence of 24 major and minor keys. This limitation can be circumvented by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the tonal space. The DFT does not rely on style-specific theoretical assumptions but only presupposes an encoding of the music as pitch classes in 12-tone equal temperament. We introduce wavescapes, a novel visualization method for tonal hierarchies that combines the visual representation of keyscapes with music analysis based on the DFT. Since wavescapes produce visual analyses deterministically, a number of potential subjective biases are removed. By concentrating on one or more Fourier coefficients, the role of the analyst is thus focused on the interpretation and contextualization of the results. We illustrate the usefulness of this method for computational music theory by analyzing eight compositions from different historical epochs and composers (Josquin, Bach, Liszt, Chopin, Scriabin, Webern, Coltrane, Ligeti) in terms of the phase and magnitude of several Fourier coefficients. We also provide a Python library that allows such visualizations to be easily generated for any piece of music for which a symbolic score or audio recording is available.},
